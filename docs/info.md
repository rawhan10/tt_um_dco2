 We gratefully acknowledge the COE in Integrated Circuits and Systems (ICAS) and Department of ECE. Our special thanks to Dr K S Geetha (Vice Principal) and, Dr. K N Subramanya (principal) for their constant support and encouragement to do TAPEOUT in Tiny Tapeout 8 .

The code provided is a SystemVerilog module that implements a Dynamic Power Management Unit (DPMU) for an SoC (System on Chip). The DPMU dynamically adjusts voltage and frequency levels based on inputs such as performance requirements, temperature, battery level, and workload. The module uses a finite state machine (FSM) to manage transitions between different power states.

Key Components

Inputs and Outputs: Inputs (ui_in): The primary input signals include performance requirements, temperature sensor data, battery level, and workload. Outputs (uo_out, uio_out): These include the power-saving indicator, voltage levels, and frequency levels for different cores and memory. I/O (uio_in, uio_out, uio_oe): Handles bidirectional signals; however, in this design, uio_in is not used, and uio_out is used for output. Internal Signals:

State Variables: state and next_state manage the FSM that controls the DPMU's behavior. Power a
